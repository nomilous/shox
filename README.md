### The Model Component - As a Service

But! First the `Model` needs to be further divided into 2 components

* the **physical** *Record* (pure and uncomplicated data access to a **SINGLE** collection/table)
* the **abstract** [Entity](https://github.com/nomilous/symbal/blob/master/requirements/relationship.coffee) (to extend the *Record* with those relational capacities traditionally expected of the Model component)

Shox is the PENDING **physical** *Record* component.
